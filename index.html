            <p class="description">Photography, for me, is more than just capturing moments—it's about studying composition and visual storytelling. I enjoy exploring how different framing techniques can change the impact of an image, from leading lines that guide the eye to carefully balanced symmetry and depth. Experimenting with various cameras and lenses fascinates me, as each setup offers a unique perspective. A 50mm prime lens creates a natural, intimate look, while a wide-angle lens expands the scene dramatically. Whether I’m using a DSLR, a mirrorless camera, or even a smartphone, I focus on how each tool translates my vision into a final image. Through photography, I continuously refine my understanding of how composition shapes emotion and meaning.</p>
            <p class="description">Beyond composition, color is a major aspect of my creative process. Different cameras and lenses render colors uniquely—some sensors emphasize warmth, while others create cooler, more neutral tones. I love experimenting with color grading to evoke different moods: rich, golden hues for warmth and nostalgia, or cool, desaturated tones for a minimalist aesthetic. The choice of lens also plays a role—vintage lenses often produce softer, dreamier tones, while modern glass delivers high-contrast clarity. Playing with light and shadow further enhances the depth and storytelling in my shots. Sometimes, I let colors shine vibrantly, while other times, a monochrome edit highlights pure form and texture. Every photograph is an opportunity to explore how color, tone, and light shape visual impact.</p>

            <p class="description">For the Betty Crocker × Scooby-Doo fruit candy collaboration, I conducted market research and found that children are the primary consumers of this product. To create packaging that resonates with them, I integrated festive themes, drawing inspiration from Halloween and Christmas—two occasions that kids associate with excitement, fun, and treats. The Halloween edition features spooky yet playful Scooby-Doo elements, such as glowing ghost silhouettes, pumpkin-orange and midnight-purple hues, and interactive designs like cut-out masks on the back of the packaging. For Christmas, I explored a more cozy, cheerful aesthetic, incorporating red, green, and gold accents, along with winter-themed Scooby-Doo illustrations.</p>
            <p class="description">Beyond aesthetics, I also studied color psychology to ensure the packaging is vibrant, engaging, and appetite-stimulating. Bright, warm colors like red, orange, and yellow enhance the candy’s fruity appeal, while cooler tones provide contrast and depth. Material choice was another key factor—I opted for eco-friendly, matte-finish packaging to balance durability and sustainability. The typography and layout were designed to be bold and playful, ensuring easy readability for children while maintaining brand consistency.</p>
            <p class="description">By combining market insights, seasonal themes, color theory, material selection, and engaging typography, this packaging concept effectively captures the spirit of fun, nostalgia, and adventure that both Betty Crocker and Scooby-Doo represent.</p>

            <p class="description">To create an effective and user-friendly packaging design for the Feastfriend™ adult bib, I conducted market research to better understand the needs and preferences of elderly consumers. The goal was to design packaging that feels dignified, functional, and visually appealing, ensuring that seniors and caregivers can easily identify and use the product.</p>
            <p class="description">One of the key considerations was color psychology. I chose soft, muted colors (pastel pink, blue, and green) to create a gentle and approachable aesthetic that aligns with comfort and trust. Each color corresponds to a different product variation, making it easier for customers to distinguish between them. The simple, minimalistic illustrations of elderly individuals using the bib emphasize functionality and relatability, ensuring that users immediately understand the product’s purpose.</p>
            <p class="description">For material selection, I opted for PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate), a lightweight, durable, and recyclable material. This choice aligns with sustainability while ensuring the packaging remains sturdy and protective. The cylindrical shape adds a premium feel while making storage more convenient.</p>
            <p class="description">In terms of typography and layout, I used IBM Plex Sans, a clean and modern sans-serif font that enhances readability for elderly consumers. The vertical brand name placement creates a sleek and contemporary visual identity, while icons and bilingual text (English & French) improve usability and accessibility.</p>
            <p class="description">Overall, this packaging design merges aesthetic appeal, functionality, and sustainability, creating a product experience that is both practical and emotionally engaging for elderly users.</p>

            <p class="description">The Research Methods of Graphic Design website utilizes a 3x3 interactive grid layout, offering a dynamic, exploratory experience. Users engage with hover-triggered elements, revealing hidden layers of text, images, and design insights. This modular structure ensures visual balance, guiding navigation while maintaining a clean and intuitive layout.</p>
            <p class="description">Typography plays a key role, featuring bold, fragmented letterforms that interact with images, reflecting deconstruction and research-driven aesthetics. The monochromatic color palette with subtle accents reinforces an academic and experimental atmosphere, allowing content to remain clear and engaging.</p>
            <p class="description">Hover-based interactions encourage non-linear exploration, making browsing more immersive. Smooth transitions and responsive animations enhance usability, turning the research into an interactive visual experience. By merging structured grids, experimental typography, and layered content, the website transforms design research into an engaging, interactive journey.</p>

            <p class="description">The website employs a structured yet unsettling composition, using a bold, serif typeface for titles and a lighter, serif font for body text, enhancing readability while maintaining a classic horror feel. The grid-based layout organizes stories in individual sections, each framed in white-bordered containers to create a sense of isolation, mimicking the feeling of reading lost documents.</p>
            <p class="description">A hover effect subtly alters the interface, revealing hidden distortions and glitches, making the experience feel unsettling. The search bar and navigation menu use high-contrast white outlines, maintaining clarity while keeping the horror theme intact. The pop-up warning message, styled like an old computer glitch, adds an element of suspense, reinforcing the website’s eerie personality.</p>
            <p class="description">The combination of dark visuals, minimalist layout, and cryptic storytelling cues makes the website feel like a haunted space rather than just a reading platform. The intentional use of negative space, stark contrasts, and suspense-building elements ensures users feel immersed in the horror experience from the moment they arrive.</p>

            <p class="description">This poster series explores glitch aesthetics and digital distortion, reflecting the intersection of technology, media errors, and visual dissonance. Inspired by broadcast test patterns and corrupted digital signals, the designs deconstruct traditional layouts into chaotic yet structured compositions, creating an unsettling yet captivating visual experience.</p>
            <p class="description">The posters incorporate high-contrast color bars, pixelated distortions, and fragmented grids, mimicking malfunctioning screens. The monospaced and blocky typography appears disrupted and misaligned, reinforcing the sense of digital interference. The shifting text, color overlays, and fragmented type forms add a sense of error and unpredictability, making the viewer feel as though they are witnessing a system failure.</p>
            <p class="description">The use of RGB-heavy color schemes (neon blues, reds, and greens) mixed with grayscale elements references the CRT screen era and test card visuals. The repetition of grid structures and scan lines mirrors the breakdown of structured information, visually representing themes of data corruption, lost signals, and media decay..</p>
            <p class="description">Beyond aesthetics, the posters symbolize the fragility of digital systems and how modern technology is prone to errors and distortion. By embracing glitches as an artistic tool, the series turns technical failures into creative expression, questioning our dependence on digital accuracy and the beauty found in imperfection.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="description">My illustration style explores the intersection of minimalism, surrealism, and emotional storytelling, often using monochrome palettes to highlight contrast and depth. Through a mix of line work, abstract shapes, and organic textures, I create visuals that are both delicate and bold, allowing emotions and narratives to emerge from the simplest compositions.</p>
            <p class="description">I specialize in expressive ink-like line drawings and layered digital illustrations, often integrating symbolism and surrealist elements. The use of negative space plays a crucial role in my work, drawing the viewer into the hidden layers of meaning behind each piece. Whether it's a fluid, dreamlike portrait or a bold, graphic composition, my work maintains a balance between precision and organic movement.</p>
            <p class="description">Beyond aesthetics, my illustrations often explore themes of introspection, human connection, and the subconscious mind. From delicate, one-line portraits to highly detailed textural compositions, each piece aims to evoke a sense of mystery and emotion. By merging traditional and digital techniques, I strive to push the boundaries of visual storytelling, creating illustrations that feel timeless yet deeply personal.</p>
